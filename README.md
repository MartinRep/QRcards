Script to create compact payment details 

This script takes all the monthly bills PDFs from directory `faktury` and extract from them Clients details: Name, Address, IBAN, BIC, account number, amount to pay and the QR code for payment system.
It will create a compact card for each client with all the nesessary details to make a payment at a post office.  
  
The idea is that clients can carry this compact card in their wallets instead of bringing printed out bill everytime they want to make a payment.
